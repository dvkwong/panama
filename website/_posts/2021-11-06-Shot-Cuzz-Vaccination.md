Tēnā koutou katoa,

Thank you to Tarsh and the Manurewa Marae team for your support for our second round of vaccinations.

We will have the shot cuzz bus down at the riverside community centre on 6th November from 11am
There will be free coffees, ice cream and kai packs and vouchers available to everyone getting vaccinated 

Please if we can have the attached flyer shared, printed and distributed it would be much appreciated

Ngā mihi
Josh
