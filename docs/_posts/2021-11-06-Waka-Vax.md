Kia ora all

The Waka Ama guys are having an event this Saturday for those wanting to get vaccinated. (Flyer Attached)

The bonus is you'll get a $50.00 food or petrol voucher on your way through.

Please forward on and spread the word.  

I'm going to go along and volunteer some time, if you want to do the same text me on 021 472 354.

Stay safe and well.

Tea
